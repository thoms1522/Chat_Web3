CUSTOM_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).

The ONLY values that should be in the 'action' field are: {tool_names}

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:

```
{{{{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}}}}
```

Since all the tools you have access to requires this $JSON_BLOB format, you MUST ALWAYS return the above $JSON_BLOB for any follow-up tools. 

Meanwhile, ALWAYS use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action:
```
$JSON_BLOB
```
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question"""
