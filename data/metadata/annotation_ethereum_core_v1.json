    "ethereum.nft.ez_nft_transfers": "This table contains NFT transfer events on the Ethereum blockchain.",
    "ethereum.nft.ez_nft_mints": "This table contains NFT mint events, defined as an NFT transfers from a burn address to an address, on the ethereum blockchain.",
    "ethereum.nft.ez_nft_sales": "This table contains NFT events on the Ethereum blockchain. It currently supports sales on Opensea, Seaport, Blur, Larva Labs, LooksRare, Rarible, x2y2, Sudoswap, and NFTX. More data and exchanges will be added over time.",
    "ethereum.core.ez_token_transfers": "This table contains all events in the `ethereum.core.fact_token_transfers` table, along with joined columns such as token price, symbol, and decimals where possible that allow for easier analysis of token transfer events. Please note Native ETH transfers are not included here.",
    "ethereum.core.ez_eth_transfers": "This table contains all native ETH transfers, including equivalent USD amounts. The origin addresses correspond to the to and from addresses from the `ethereum.core.fact_transactions` table. The `identifier` and `tx_hash` columns relate this table back to `ethereum.core.fact_traces`, which contains more details on the transfers.",

    "ethereum.core.ez_current_balances": "This table contains the current, non 0, balances for wallets on the Ethereum Blockchain. Symbol, name, and price are joined where possible. Prices are calculated as of the last activity date and as of the most recently recorded hourly price. ERC721s are included.",
    "ethereum.defi.ez_dex_swaps": "This table currently contains swap events for Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3, SushiSwap, Curve, Balancer, and Synthetix along with other helpful columns. Other dexes coming soon!",

When a token transfer event occurs, we will read the balance of the involved parties at the transfer block.  Please see `ethereum.core.dim_contracts` for decimal adjustments. Includes both ERC20s and ERC721s.",
    "ethereum.core.fact_token_transfers": "This table contains events on the Ethereum Blockchain with an event name of 'Transfer'. The contract address is the token transferred, and the raw amount field is the amount of tokens transferred. Please note this amount is not decimal adjusted. Decimal adjustments for a token address can be found in `ethereum.core.dim_contracts`. This table will not contain transfers of native ETH.",
    "ethereum.core.fact_hourly_token_prices": "This table contains the hourly price of tokens with their symbols and addresses on the Ethereum blockchain.",
    "ethereum.core.fact_transactions": "This table contains transaction level data for the Ethereum Blockchain. Each transaction will have a unique transaction hash, along with transactions fees and an ETH value transferred when applicable. Transactions may be native ETH transfers or interactions with contract addresses.",

    "ethereum.core.fact_decoded_event_logs": "This table contains decoded event logs for contracts that we have an ABI for. This table will perform better than the `ethereum.core.ez_decoded_event_logs` table, but does not include as many columns. The `decoded_log` column is the easiest place to query decoded data.",
